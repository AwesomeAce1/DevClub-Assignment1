        <h2 id= "Myths">Myths Vs Truths</h2>
        <p><b>Myth</b> : Vitamin and mineral based supplements can be used to prevent COVID-19
            <br>
            <b>Fact</b> : No, there is no evidence to support this claim.
            <br>While it is true that micronutrients, such as vitamins D and C and zinc, are critical for a well-functioning immune system and play a vital role in promoting health and nutritional well-being.  There is currently no guidance on the use of micronutrient supplements as a treatment of COVID-19.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
            <b>Myth</b> : Medicines like dexamethasone and hydrochloroquine can be self-medicated for cure for COVID-19
            <br><b>Fact</b> : While these medicines do help in cure covid for some cases, this only depends on case by case basis.
            For some people, this may even do more harm than good. Follow the advice of doctor. Stockpiling these medicines for later use helps noone.
            <br><br><br>
            <b>Myth</b> : We should not order online as there is a chance that we can get COVID-19 from recieved goods.
            <br><b>Fact</b> : There is a negligible likelihood that COVID-19 can spread this way. Infact, prefer to order online instead of going to the other side of the city to get a good.
